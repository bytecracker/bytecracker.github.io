Hi, I'm Alex and I'd like to tell you a story -- one of relentless apathy and mindless, slipshod decisions resulting in a body even Jabba the Hutt would envy. It'll take a while but stick it out and I promise you won't regret it. Here's me -- not a single darned care in the world; about as a graceful as an elephant on roller skates. And my social life? Yeah, you can only get so popular when stand out like a hooker at an Amish prayer meeting no matter where you are or what you're wearing.
I could keep on shedding bits of proof that my colossal bulge was life-threatening to me and anyone in my immediate vicinity like hailstones off a tin roof but I think by now you've probably caught my drift.

So deep, deep, deep, very deep down, however deep down it was, I could feel a faint, eerie tingling inside of me gently urging me to rethink my ways, to turn my life around, though it might've been more of a hungry gurgling; my god, I was starving, hadn't had a single bite since forever. The distant memory of my delightful roasted turkey breast sandwich I had on the bus was slowly, painfully fading.
